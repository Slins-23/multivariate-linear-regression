# Multivariate Linear Regression

A Python implementation from scratch of multivariate linear regression, through gradient descent. (Or univariate) 

This is my first machine learning project as I started to study it one week ago and I superficially studied linear regression. Expect accuracy and speed issues, typos, etc.

There are too many prompt settings, which is a design choice as I want to have and give whoever as much control, as generally as possible over the script. However, one big downside of this choice, which is inverselly proportional to the amount of control, is the easy of use and clarity. This is specially apparent in the command line. The more detail, customization, and control, the messier it is to read, the easier it is to make mistakes and also easy to forget implementation details as you type away with every new prompt. If I made a web interface for this, it would be much easier to use, but that wasn't my intention when making this.

Distance comparison done through euclidean distance

The reference values are compared against the dataset before it gets normalized. It would be ideal to add yet another user prompt to control when to compare these reference values to the dataset.

Add cosine similarity for distance (would account for strings as well)
